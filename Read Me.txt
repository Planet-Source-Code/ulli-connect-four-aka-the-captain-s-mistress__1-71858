During his long sea voyages, Captain Cook was apparently often absent in the evenings and eventually the crew began to joke that he must have a mistress in his cabin.

This program uses bitmaps to represent the Board, iterative Search deepening, Alpha-Beta pruning, and Principal Variation search. No positional evaluation is made at the search tree leaves, it simply relies on search depth to find winning combinations. Search depth is about 10 to 12 with a two seconds time check (Advanced level). The program is hard to beat even in Beginner mode.

Human player has yellow and starts. Click on any chip at the top to drop it into the slot beneath.
